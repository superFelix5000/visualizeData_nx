# monorepo exploration project

This started with moving my [bank data visualization project](https://github.com/superFelix5000/visualizeData) over to an NX monorepo. My plan now is to move all my side projects here if possible and let them share as much code as possible.

## content
- Angular frontend for bank data visualization
- [Deno backend](https://github.com/superFelix5000/bankDataServer) for holding the bank data 
- Ionic/Capacitor mobile app (which is empty for now) for testing the visualization on mobile
