# monorepo exploration project

This started with moving my [bank data visualization project](https://github.com/superFelix5000/visualizeData) over to an NX monorepo. My plan now is to move all my side projects here if possible and let them share as much code as possible.

As of now it holds the initial Angular frontend, the deno backend and an empty ionic/capacitor/angular mobile app project.
